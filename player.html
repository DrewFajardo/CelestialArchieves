									Growing up as a child soldier, Cody Pyre is a force to be reckoned with, besides her volatile and
									violent nature, she is a devastating combatant.
									<br>
									<br>
									Cody Pyre is a well-known Blazeborn known for being part of the frontlines of the battles and 
									sieges alike. Why? It seems as though this blazeborn in particular has a low threshold making her 
									devastatingly motivated in combat. Coinciding with the fact that she relishes each battle she 
									enters in as she is a Pigkin herself. A ruthless brute in battle but a calm and clever medic in 
									the barracks. She is more reliant on her combat ability than heavily relying on her to treat you 
									in battle, but she does provide great cover for any ally that needs healing and backup.
									<br> 
									<br>
									Such a great soldier comes with a troublesome and violent upbringing. She was known to be the 
									youngest to be taken in for training, having her family killed as she was taken away by the 
									empire troops by force. Every day she was scorned for her unwillingness to cooperate until the 
									higher-ups decided to go about punishing those who failed or those who disobeyed. Cody was part 
									of the latter, which made her a target for abuse amongst her peers and higher-ups. But even so 
									every day, even on days she does decide to follow through and comply with all requests she is 
									still punished in the most backhanded way possible, even sometimes ranging to having petty 
									reasoning. 
									<br>
									<br>
									She doesn't miss a day when she would be poured water over her hands by her captains. Which by 
									Blazeborn anatomy is very painful, as it's the equivalent of giving an Overworldian a second-
									degree burn. Due to this traumatic and painful treatment on her hands, Cody's hands have turned 
									into the shade of coal, her skin charred, devoid of any heat and sensations from her hands. It 
									was still functional, yes, but she felt as though it was not there.
									<br>
									<br>
									The constant berating, abuse, and immense training have hard conditioned Cody to be cynical all 
									throughout growing up. Only believe that she's good for battle uses. To survive in everyday life 
									is to always fight. 
									<br>
									<br>
									One of these days she's going to snap at this everyday cycle. Maybe even cause the biggest 
									massacres in her state of bloodlust. After all she is known to be the crimson reaper for a good 
									reason.

									Willow favors his solitude more than anything-- a reserved individual who keeps a lot to 
									himself. Commonly seen to be wearing a wooden carved mask at all times. But there would be rare 
									instances that he would take them off around certain people or certain circumstances. Though 
									this is just but a mere speculation.
									<br>
									<br>
									Due to being a Floran, Willow spends a lot of his daytime walking and exploring places, never 
									seemingly settling anywhere, a nomad. People would see him around to help where he can to ensure 
									people are pleased and maintained throughout the day. Though can be called helpful, it is more 
									of an innate need for Willow to make people happy or at the very least comfortable-- thus 
									leading to his seeming overly generous attitude. But even with all that said he is not attached 
									to anyone and just leaves without a word the next day. Seemingly off to another place to roam 
									about. Florans rely for the most part to have sunlight as their main food source always giving 
									Florans the energy to go around places during the day and rest or create a temporary safety hut 
									for the night. Or at least stay above ground and live off on honey for the night if he has to 
									continue traversing through the night. 
									<br>
									<br>
									Friendly as he appears to be, Willow doesn't hesitate to create a contingency plan with people 
									he regularly interacts with, be it a close friend neighbour, he's passively on edge as if he's 
									living with a knife pointed at his back constantly. He is prepared for the worst of everyone.
									<br>
									<br>
									Not a lot is known about Willow's upbringing as he himself tends to not really talk about it, 
									and for the most part avoids talking anything about himself. If any attempts were made he would 
									redirect it back to the other person, shooting any attempt for any openings.
									<br>
									<br>
									His reservation is an attempt to sever any attempt of attachments and connections and it can be 
									seen as pointless for Willow seems to be on the go. No use in creating these memories when he'll 
									eventually leave it all behind and never look back on it. Thus making Willow the most self-
									reliant person that he is. Only doing things to get by, seemingly aimlessly, or perhaps in 
									search of something but is adamant about the sentiment of the latter.
									<br>
									<br>
									Others would see him roam about places with a lot of Fire Resistance potions at times, but never 
									really going to the Nether as it seems. Perhaps in touch with a Blazeborn, but no one can be for 
									sure about it as nobody seems to know where Willow's next destination could be.
